### Hi there, i am mustapha!ðŸ‘‹ and i do software engineering.

I have been making fullstack MVPs for few startups, and now i work as full time backend engineer.

i enjoy software engineering, and though i am framework agnostic, i like FastApi, NestJs, Django, and ReactJs.

most of my work is private but will soon go with more open source tools or public projects.

i build things with python and Javascript (TypeScript), modern backend systems, SQL databases, Docker, AI APIs, and modern UIs.
