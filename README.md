### Hi there, i am mustapha, a software developer a network engineer ðŸ‘‹

i love wireless networks, but i am currently more active in making APIs for websites or ai models,i enjoy ReactJs and make UIs when needed.

most of my work is private but will soon go with more open source tools or public projects.
i use python and Javascript, because i like to make Deep/machine learning models,databases, docker images,backend APIs, and frontend Ui using ReactJs and tailwind, and surely, i am still learning always.

my favorite framework for APIs is âš¡fastApiâš¡,Reactjs for frontend and tailwindcss for styling, yet i know and use ðŸŒ±FlaskðŸŒ±, Django, bootstrap, nestjs and few others when needed!
