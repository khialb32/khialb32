### Hi there, i am Mustapha!ðŸ‘‹ and i do Software Engineering.

I have been making fullstack MVPs for few startups, and now i work as full time backend engineer.

i enjoy software engineering, and though i am framework agnostic, i like FastApi, NestJs, Django, and ReactJs.

most of my work is private but will soon go with more open-source tools or public projects.

I build systems using TypeScript, Python, C#, SQL databases, Docker, and few others.
