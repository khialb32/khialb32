### Hi there, i am mustapha, a software developer and an ML engineer ðŸ‘‹

I am currently  active in making web apps, and ML APIs for NLP and SA,i enjoy ReactJs and make beautiful UIs when needed.

most of my work is private but will soon go with more open source tools or public projects.
i use python and Javascript, because i like to make Deep/machine learning models,databases, docker images,backend APIs, and frontend Ui using ReactJs and tailwind, and surely, i am still learning always.

my favorite framework for web APIs is âš¡fastApiâš¡, for frontend i use Reactjs, redux, and tailwindcss for styling, yet i know and use ðŸŒ±FlaskðŸŒ±, Django, bootstrap, nextjs and few others when needed!
